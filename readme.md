2024-aug-14 -- JPS
So today I worked on live graphics.
Working so far, though I want to add in a time uniform, but sokol does not support uniform buffers.
Well, it kinda does, but not as their own buffers; it seems they give us some 4 slots to pass uniform info in.
I think I just have to adjust the sokol shader description, as right now I am basically just using the boilerplate from example 07.
I would bet, as I am writing this, that there is probably a uniform buffer example -- I'll go check.
